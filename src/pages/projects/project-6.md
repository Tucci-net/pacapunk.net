After over 2 Years of working within the Audio Visual Scene at Eastern I was given the delightful oppurtunity from my boss to provide a vinyl job for the new company work van! The overall concept, scale and visualization was developed in Winter QTR'23 but design implementation and application all took place during Spring Quarter over 10 week period. This truly put a lot of my solo skills to the test along with providing a lot of detail and knowledge on how to exactly implement designs on vehicles!
