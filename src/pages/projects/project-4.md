### This One's a Doozy!

To keep it less than a 20 minute discussion on how a neural network actually works

and how it needs a solid chunk of CPU. This Skull was a still life I painted digitally 

back in highschool. From there, I took some time to utilize my very own neural 

network software to digitally recreate the image utilizing waveforms like a

[Seismometer!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismometer) With this data visualizer, I scanned the painting for luminosity data 

and rendered it into what you see here!
